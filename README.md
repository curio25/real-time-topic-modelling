Topic Modeling and Content Insights on Netflix Reviews End-To-End SageMaker Pipeline
===========================================



Project Overview
-------

This project aims to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using AWS SageMaker to perform topic modeling and extract content insights from Netflix reviews data. The primary objectives are to identify key topics in the reviews, analyze viewer interests and feedback, and visualize trends using AWS QuickSight. Additionally, the project will simulate real-time data integration to demonstrate the pipeline's capability to handle live updates.

Objectives
-------

1.  **Topic Modeling**: Apply BERTopic to categorize Netflix reviews into key topics.
    
2.  **Content Insights**: Analyze the distribution of topics to gain insights into viewer interests, preferences, and feedback on specific content.
    
3.  **Visualization**: Use AWS QuickSight to create interactive dashboards displaying topic trends and insights for content strategy teams.
    
4.  **Real-Time Simulation**: Simulate real-time reviews into the pipeline to demonstrate the system's ability to handle live data updates.

    *   **Topic Modeling**: Train a BERTopic model to identify key topics in the review data.
        
    *   **Content Insights**: Analyze the distribution of topics and perform sentiment analysis to gauge viewer sentiment.
        
    *   **Visualization**: Create dashboards in AWS QuickSight to visualize topic trends and insights.
        
2.  **Phase 2: Real-Time Data Simulation**
    
    *   **Streaming Data Pipeline**: Set up AWS services (e.g., Kinesis, Lambda) to simulate real-time review data ingestion.
        
    *   **Real-Time Processing**: Implement Lambda functions to process streaming data and update the SageMaker model predictions.
        
    *   **Dashboard Integration**: Ensure the QuickSight dashboards update in real-time to reflect new data.


Project Workflow
